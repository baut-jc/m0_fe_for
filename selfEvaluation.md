# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I could keep putting it in practice to be more fluent with this lesson.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I would like to practice efficient googling strategies.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
Where could anybody find the best resource for methods/parameters for javascript efficiently?
